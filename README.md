I am an experienced technology professional with a broad background in Information Technology. I have successfully contributed to projects such as UrbanCity RP, [BlitheMC](https://blithemc.co), and [I:COA](https://indianacoa.com/team). My role as a Tier 1 IT Helpdesk Technician has honed my problem-solving and solution implementation skills. I actively participate in project discussions and have developed in-house solutions. With extensive experience in FiveM, I am a regular contributor to CFX communications on Discord, staying well-informed on updates and changes affecting FiveM servers and players.

- Ban Appeals System
- Jira (SaaS) systems for managing staff hiring, retention, and onboarding through customized workflows
- Discord Bot for managing HTTPasswd creation for Apache/Nginx systems, centralizing credentials on an agile-browser endpoint
- Okta & Okta ASA implementation for least-privileged access to secure cloud resources while maintaining identity security.
