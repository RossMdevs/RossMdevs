### Hello! I am Ross Mersch,

I am a **experienced** individual working with many areas of Information Technology. I've worked on projects such as [BlitheMC](https://blithemc.co) & [I:COA](https://indianacoa.com/team). I am also a former Tier 1 IT Helpdesk technican with Problem-Solving and Isolation skills specializing in Solution Deployment.

I've designed and and deployed solutions both in the cloud and in Local Networks with agile security on Layer7 (OSI/Cloudflare) & Layer 3 (OSI/Linux). I've worked with technology for many years with a passion for making things work for others. 

# How I do it?

I dedicate and volunteer my time towards those whom I observe and identify issues. I provide my services **entirely free**, whilst providing the end-user with a cost effective methodology to approach complex and critical issues. If I can't fix an issue myself, I will dedicate the resources to isolate and learn a fix towards an issue, whether temporarily or permanently.
