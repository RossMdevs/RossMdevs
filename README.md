### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
### I am Ross Mersch,

I am a Network Administrator for [RLMTECH](https://rlmtech.xyz). I run a dedicated website, develop small stuff, promote ideas, listen to music, and participate in community discussions.

If you ever need to, you may always contact me across my networks.

I consult with new organizations/projects on their needs, product suggestions, and startups. I volunteer my time with new communities to help them grow into an ideal enviornment. I have plenty of experience in community managment, team directives, and startups. If you'd like me to help with any of your community startups with community engagment, directives, rules, polices or staff placement.
