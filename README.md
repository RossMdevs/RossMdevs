### Hello, I’m Ross.

# About Me  

Hello, I’m **U123** (or **Ross**). I’m 23 years old and passionate about working with complex technologies and agile networks. I consider myself a **Network Ops Developer** and **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer**, with experience in authentication platforms like **Auth0 (ADP)** and **Okta**, on-call systems such as **PagerDuty**, and enterprise security tooling, including:  

- **Active Directory** (Networked Group Policy, Networked Security Policies, Unified Login Solutions, and Federated Tree Forests)  
- **WireGuard** and **IP security protocols**  
- **Alerting systems**  

My expertise extends to **Linux**, **DHCP & DNS management**, **user onboarding experiences and tooling**, and **user support and design experiences (CSX/UDX)**. I have also designed **small-scale tooling solutions** for projects I’ve been involved with.  

## Background & Experience  

My background includes working with foundational systems like **Active Directory** and **Entra ID**, as well as security solutions such as **CrowdStrike** and **XDR/EDR**. Additionally, I have experience with tools like **Jira**, **self-hosted SaaS**, and **ELPC**.  

I have worked with various **cloud solutions** and previously served as a **Tier 1 Helpdesk Technician** at a Managed Service Provider in my state. Beyond that, I have taken on roles as a **technology consultant** and **senior developer** for smaller projects that continue to thrive today.  

## Cloud & Infrastructure Management  

I have extensive experience managing **cloud-native infrastructures**, including:  

- **SFTP/FTP server deployment**  
- **Dedicated server management**  
- **IP address and rDNS configuration**  
- **Mail server deployment**  
- **DNS records management**  

I have handled the majority of startup infrastructure tasks, along with moderate-level **network engineering** responsibilities.  

## Consulting & Development  

In addition to **owning an LLC**, I have contributed to several **technology startups**, offering expertise in:  

- **IT consulting**  
- **Server administration**  
- **Security best practices**  

I have experience managing **cPanel** environments for web hosting, configuring **MariaDB** and **SQL Server** databases, and optimizing **Ubuntu-based server deployments** for **reliability and security**.  

## Community & Volunteer Work  

I have a background in **volunteer work** and **community-driven projects**, particularly in **roleplay gaming communities**, where I have:  

- Developed **custom panels**  
- Created **moderation tools** to streamline administrative processes  

My ability to **identify and resolve IT infrastructure issues**, along with my **zero-tolerance approach to inefficiency and misconduct**, has enabled me to successfully manage both **technical** and **operational** challenges in various settings.  

Beyond my work in technology, I get involved in **local initiatives**, such as **volunteering at a county warming shelter**. I also stay active in my community, continue to develop my skills, and **mentor aspiring IT professionals** to help them grow in the field.  

### The Digital Impact I've Made:
My digital impact has been significant. I’ve reduced project costs by 50%, developed innovative solutions that enable non-technical users to navigate complex systems with ease, and organized workshops and training programs to enhance understanding of advanced technologies. I’ve implemented robust safety measures that withstand brute force attempts and created virtual Disaster Recovery Plans for communities that can't risk downtime. Every project I’ve been involved in has left the owners satisfied, often receiving applause for the work completed.
