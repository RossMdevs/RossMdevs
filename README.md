### My Approach

I dedicate my time to volunteering for those facing challenges in IT. I offer my services **entirely free**, providing users with cost-effective methods to address complex and critical issues. If I encounter a problem I can’t resolve immediately, I commit to isolating and researching a solution, whether temporary or permanent.
